Problem Statement:
Time management is very important for students these days.  They need to analyze how much time they actually utilize for studying . They need to eliminate distractions  like social media and be focused at the task at hand . They need to allocate and manage their time better. Also  students need something interactive to remind them to study .

Our device ,study clock , will be able to solve these common problems faced by most of the students. Our device will calculate the time for which a student actually studies on his study table. A student will also be able to set reminders and our  study clock will interact with the student to remind him . A student can also calculate the time he takes to solve a problem. Also students face the problem of falling asleep when he/she is studying at night. Our clock will wake them up if they sleep while studying.

A phone and other devices cannot calculate the actual time for which a student studies on his study table . Though  reminders can be set in the   phone too  but while studying the students get distracted by the use of phone reminders and start using applications to entertain themselves instead.  The stopwatch also does the same . 

While studying a student needs to concentrate only on his work . Our  study clock helps them to do the same by giving them a detailed analysis of the usage of their time spent on studies . Students need something interactive to remind them and so our device  encourages them to work according to their time table  with it's interactive reminder system.
